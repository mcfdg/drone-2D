# Drone 2D

I was interested in the precision that is needed for a drone to stay perfectly horizontal in the air and still move around. That is why all drones have assisting software, i.e. the software does most of the work, not the human. In this game however the player is in full control of the propellers' movement.

Moreover, this game features the first two dimensional drone (as far as I know). Even though it only has two propellers instead of four, you will notice that it is already extremely challenging to control it.
